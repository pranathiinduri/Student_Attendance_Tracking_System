# Student_Attendance_Tracking_System
This project focuses on developing an **automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology**. The system utilizes Haar-like features and cascading classifiers to detect human faces with high efficiency and accuracy. By integrating the OpenCV library's algorithms, such as gentle AdaBoost and Haar feature-based detection, the project achieves real-time facial recognition, eliminating the need for manual attendance input by students or teachers.

The system enhances the accuracy of attendance recording by achieving a 90% detection rate, as demonstrated by Viola and Jones, and significantly reduces false alarm rates through effective classifier training. The solution is designed to be easily integrated with existing computer vision applications, ensuring a user-friendly implementation that can be adapted to various educational environments.
