# Student_Attendance_Tracking_System
This project focuses on developing an **automated attendance tracking system using facial recognition technology**. The system utilizes Haar-like features and cascading classifiers to detect human faces with high efficiency and accuracy. By integrating the OpenCV library's algorithms, such as gentle AdaBoost and Haar feature-based detection, the project achieves real-time facial recognition, eliminating the need for manual attendance input by students or teachers.

The system enhances the accuracy of attendance recording by achieving a 90% detection rate, as demonstrated by Viola and Jones, and significantly reduces false alarm rates through effective classifier training. The solution is designed to be easily integrated with existing computer vision applications, ensuring a user-friendly implementation that can be adapted to various educational environments.

****There is a student details page where the student enters his/her details,take a photo sample,update or delete details.**

**The next step is to train the model with images so the student clicks on take photo sample and images clicked.**

**After the images are clicked the next step is to train the model with the images**

**When the training is completed it pops up a message saying the traing dataset is completed**

**Here comes the recognition part where the face of the student is recognised with the rollno,name and the Branch**

**For example there is an unknown face that is not trained on the model then the model recognises that as an unknown face

When the Student face is recognised ,the students attendance is stored in a database and we can track the student's attendance.
